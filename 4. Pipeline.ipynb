    "\n",
    "#### Outline\n",
    "Pipeline:\n",
    "- Only use counties and states that are in the Covid and health data sets\n",
    "- Use spark, mostly rely on dataframes but sometimes use temporary database views for convenience\n",
    "- End result should be outputting parquet files\n",
    "\n",
    "State facts:\n",
    "- Start Covid-19 data, use the state abbreviation as a link to states, timestamp to time\n",
    "- Calculate aggregate Covid-19 cases and deaths (both total and delta) for each day based on county facts table, group by state\n",
    "- Partition by state, then month\n",

    "* Load the parquet files into the database\n",
