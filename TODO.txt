TODO:

Schema:
- County facts table with FIPS for reference, date reference, Covid cases and deaths as well as weather data
- State facts table with abbreviation for reference, date reference, Covid cases and deaths

- Time dimension table with date stamp, year, month, week, day and weekday
- County dimension table with FIPS, county name, state reference, health data
- State dimension table with abbreviation, state name, health data

Pipeline:
- Only use counties and states that are in the Covid and health data sets

Time dim:
- Create from Covid-19 data as a start, use column names as key, extract year/month/week/day/weekday from there
- Fill in missing days from weather data

County dim:
- Create county dimension table from Covid-19 data as a start
- Fill in missing FIPS codes based on matching county names with health data
- Augment county table with health data
- Augment with area and population density (using health data and area data)
- Use state abbreviation as foreign key for state table (which is created afterwards)

County facts:
- Start with the Covid-19 data set, use the timestamps to link to time, use FIPS to link to counties
- Add the covid cases and deaths from the data set
- Augment with weather data based on the timestamp and county

State dim:
- Create state dimension table from health data as a start
- Calculate area and population density based on county dim table, group by state

- State facts:
- Start Covid-19 data, use the state abbreviation as a link to states, timestamp to time
- Calculate aggregate Covid-19 cases for each day based on county facts table, group by state

Stretch:
- Election data for county dimension table
- Mobility data over time, as part of county facts table (since it's a time series)
