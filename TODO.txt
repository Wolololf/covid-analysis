Redshift: Stage data from S3 bucket to Redshift
- Create table statements
- Delete table statements
- Copy statements
- Copy Infrastructure-As-Code setup from the Data Warehouse Project
- Copy connection and shutdown code from the same project

Stretch:
- Election data for county dimension table
- Mobility data over time, as part of county facts table (since it's a time series)
