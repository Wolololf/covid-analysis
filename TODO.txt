TODO:

Clean:
- Store cleaned data with schema: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56707401/save-schema-of-dataframe-in-s3-location
- Inner-join county tables on FIPS code: https://sparkbyexamples.com/spark/spark-sql-dataframe-join/#sql-inner-join

Stretch:
- Election data for county dimension table
- Mobility data over time, as part of county facts table (since it's a time series)
