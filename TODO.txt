S3: Upload final ETL output to S3 instead of local

Redshift: Stage data from S3 bucket to Redshift
- Create table statements
- Delete table statements
- Copy statements
- Copy Infrastructure-As-Code setup from the Data Warehouse Project
- Copy connection and shutdown code from the same project

Stretch:
- Election data for county dimension table
- Mobility data over time, as part of county facts table (since it's a time series)

Effect of bad weather on covid case rates
"A harder question to answer is how much weather on any given day affects covid case rates a few days down the line.  
Since the reporting won't be extremely accurate, we should limit ourselves to evaluating strings of consistently good/bad weather for a few days, and then look at the new case increase a week afterwards.

First, we need to classify what makes a day "good" or "bad". I'd define a "good" day as having low chance of precipitation and low cloud cover, whereas a "bad" day is high on both. We could include temperature here as well, but we'd need to look at a rolling average to see how any given day compares; this presents a problem since rolling averages don't play well with the idea of having a period of good/bad days (they're subsequent days, so the last day in the sequence would need e.g. a higher temperature than the preceding days even though they were classed as "good" already).

Next, we need to indentify sufficiently long sequences of days with similar weather.  
Then we can determine the cases a week from each day, and track the delta.

Finally, we can average the delta for good/bad weather days and see if we can find any difference.""
