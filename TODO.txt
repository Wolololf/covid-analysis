TODO:

Cleaning:
- Drop all rows with final date value of 0, these rows have no data

Model/ETL:
- Add case_delta and death_delta columns to state and county fact tables
- Rebuild model image
- Update creation SQL
- Update column description and justification

Stretch:
- Election data for county dimension table
- Mobility data over time, as part of county facts table (since it's a time series)
